Got it. I’ll look for the best public GroupMe API hacks and open-source projects that help with:

* Growing and managing groups or communities
* Automating affiliate marketing or engagement workflows
* Building or extending bots for message handling, posting, or user management

I’ll include real examples, GitHub repos if available, and implementation tips for you to build or adapt these. I’ll let you know as soon as I have the results ready.
Unconventional & Edge Hacks Using the GroupMe API

Real-time push / long-poll subscription to capture events instantly

Beyond relying only on webhooks, you can use the GroupMe push / Faye protocol (the “push” server) to subscribe to group channels and get live events (messages) using long-polling or real-time channels.

For instance, one guide shows doing a handshake to get a clientId and then subscribing to /group/{group_id} via push.faye endpoint. When new messages arrive, you get them immediately. 
Stack Overflow

With that, you can react faster than webhook latency—e.g. detect a user posting “I want to buy” and respond in real-time, or automatically invite them to another group before they leave.

Message stitching / content echoing across groups

If you manage multiple groups or interest verticals, you can automatically mirror select messages (especially ones with high engagement) from one group to another.

E.g. your “Deals Group” sees a post, bot captures it, then reposts (with attribution) into a “General community group” to spark interest, with a link back to your main group.

This effectively promotes cross-pollination. Because you own the bot posting, you can filter which posts get echoed (e.g. top liked, flagged by model).

“Ghost invitations” via dynamic share link generation

Use the GET /groups response to grab the group’s share_url (join link) (provided by GroupMe).

Then dynamically embed that link into messages in related group chats or even external channels (social media, forums). Whenever someone clicks, they join without manual add (if share is enabled).

You can rotate or regenerate share URLs (if GroupMe allows) to invalidate old ones and maintain funnel control.

Adaptive message frequency / “burst mode” control

Track rate of user activity via GET /groups/{group_id}/messages and dynamically throttle or accelerate your bot’s promotional messages.

If user engagement is high, your bot can increase frequency of promotional content. If quiet, drop back to low frequency to avoid spam.

Use engagement metrics (message count, likes) as signal to push offers when “the group is active.”

“Soft opt-in” mechanisms via engagement triggers

Instead of auto-adding everyone, watch users who actively post or react frequently, and then send them DM invites to upgrade/funnel groups.

For example: user posts “I’m interested in deals,” bot picks that as a signal and sends a private message: “Want to join the inner deal group?” This feels less spammy and more opt-in.

Auto-liking / feedback loop to influence group dynamics

Use POST /messages/{conversation_id}/{message_id}/like to like messages from users you want to encourage.

This is subtle: by liking posts of “power users,” you encourage more posting and retention. Your bot can bias the “signal” in the group by liking messages that align with growth or promo goals.

Message reconstruction for stealth messaging / delay

Intercept a user’s message, slightly delay or slightly modify it (e.g. add a tag or affiliate call) before reposting (if allowed) — essentially acting as proxy.

For example, a user says “I want to buy X,” bot re-posts: “User wants to buy X — here’s a link to buy it” a few seconds later, making the bot’s message feel like part of conversation.

Use moderation logic to avoid duplication / spam detection.

Content mining & data intelligence for micro-targeting

Use the “hacking-groupme” repo to scan for patterns / stats in groups: e.g. top users, who gives the most likes, most active hours. 
GitHub

Then schedule your promotional content at times when top users are online to maximize reach.

Or detect users who post about “buy”, “new gear”, “I’m looking for X” and respond with targeted affiliate suggestions.

Automatic group segmentation micro-groups

Within a big group, create subgroups based on interest (e.g. “deal-seekers”, “product testers”) and programmatically invite users into those subgroups based on signals (posting behavior, keywords).

Use bot commands: "Would you like to join the ‘Deals’ group (Yes / No)?" and auto-add those who respond yes.

This segmentation helps tailor message frequency / offers per sub-interest and reduce noise in main group.

Rate-limited feedback loops for A/B testing

Use the API to run A/B experiments inside the group: post variant A vs variant B messages to random subsets of users (via robot DMs or in a private group segment) and measure which one gets more click / response.

Use GET /groups/{id}/messages + like counts as feedback to adjust content copy, timing, or offer types.

Auto-DM onboarding & funneling

When someone joins (detect via join event in callback), immediately send them a private direct chat (if possible) — a welcome message, orientation, or invite to your premium / deals group.

Use it to collect preferences (“What topics interest you?”) and segment them.

Helps reduce noise in the main group while still engaging newcomers.

Progressive permission escalation / gamification

Start new users in a “trial / limited” mode: fewer privileges, limited commands.

As they engage (post, like, stay active), your bot promotes them automatically (if your system supports roles) or unlocks more features / group invites.

Essentially gamify retention & trust: high engagement = access to better groups, special commands.

“Phantom mentions” via sequential mentions

Since GroupMe doesn’t have a native “@everyone” mention, bots (like the Hubot-based “@all” project) implement it by reading the group’s member list and sending a message that individually mentions each user. This gets everyone’s attention. 
DEV Community

You can build variants: mention only active users, mention only users who haven’t posted in X days to re-engage them, or mention users in a rotating cycle so no one gets spammed every time.

Branded content / stealth affiliate injection

Embed affiliate links or product mentions not in obvious promotional posts, but in “value content” — e.g. “Here’s what I bought recently,” “I found this tool for X,” etc.

Use the bot to periodically post “tool of the day,” “tip,” or “resource” messages, referencing your affiliate or commerce links in a disguised / softer way.

Message piggy-backing / chaining replies

When a user posts a message that matches your target content (e.g. “looking for X”), your bot doesn’t post an entirely new message. Instead, it replies to that message (if reply threading is supported) or posts immediately after, making it part of the conversation — this feels more embedded and less “bot spammy.”

Use the attachments or in_reply_to_id metadata (if supported) to chain replies. (Note: GroupMe’s API doesn’t strongly support threaded replies, so this might require simulation or workaround.)

“Silent logging / leak detection / sentiment engine”

Use the bot to silently log all messages for internal analytics / sentiment detection (without responding).

You can detect trending topics or spike in keyword use (e.g. “sale,” “cheap,” “issue”) and only respond when warranted.

This acts as a background “radar” so you don’t prematurely push content.

Mirror / proxy cross-platform bridging

Connect GroupMe to other chat platforms (Discord, Slack, Telegram). When a message is posted in one platform (e.g. Discord), the bot mirrors it to the GroupMe group (or vice versa).

This increases exposure and allows you to seed content in one network and echo it to others.

For example, someone posts in Discord, your bot relays it to GroupMe, catching attention.

“Invisible reactions” / feedback simulation

Even if a user doesn’t like / react to something, your bot could programmatically like it (if allowed) to give positive reinforcement to messages you want to encourage.

Pair this with your engagement scoring to subtly shape group tone — “reward” posts that mention affiliate products, group deals, or your keywords.

Dynamic group splits / micro-target groups

Monitor subgroup topics within a large group (e.g. via topic hashtags, message themes). Automatically create new sub-groups (via API) and migrate users into those subgroups (with invite or auto-add).

You could create “interest subrooms” for users interested in tech, health, deals, etc. This increases relevance and helps you push offers only where they make sense.

“Stealth drop” group launches

Create groups on the fly (via POST /groups) with very specific niche or limited membership (e.g. “Deal alerts — tech gadgets — 100 members”).

Then the bot gradually seeds new users (from your user base) into that group with teasers.

Because the group is new and small, messages are highly visible and impactful, increasing conversion.

Time-synced “flash sale drop” events

At a preannounced time, have the bot drop a high-value offer (with affiliate link or checkout link) in the group.

Use countdown messages leading up to it.

The scarcity + synchronized timing can boost click-through / conversions.

Reverse polling / “what do you want next?” surveys

Bot posts a poll asking “Which category of product deals do you want next: A, B, C, D?”

Based on responses, your bot tailors future affiliate / commerce content to match interests.

This tightens your content-product alignment and reduces wasted posts.

“Ghost channel / hidden room” premium group

Use your main group as a funnel and occasionally send messages like “We dropped exclusive content in the hidden room — DM me to join.”

Use the bot to DM or auto-add engaged users to that hidden / premium channel. It feels special and higher value.

User-scoped experimental threads / “beta testers” group

From within a large group, invite a rotating subset of users (e.g. every week pick top 20 by engagement) to a “beta testers” group where you test new offers or features first.

Use their feedback / conversion as leading indicators for scaling to the full group.

ush / real-time subscription (Faye / Push) hacks

Use the GroupMe push / Faye interface to subscribe to group channels (e.g. /group/{group_id}) so you get message events in real time via long-polling or websockets, rather than just relying on webhooks. A StackOverflow post shows how to do handshake, subscribe, and connect cycles. 
Stack Overflow

Having that gives you ability to react instantly (e.g. auto-invite, auto-reply) with lower latency

You can maintain a persistent listener to detect patterns / aggregated triggers

2. “@all” mention bot via Hubot

A project exists that gives you an @all style mention in GroupMe: when users type @all, the bot reposts the message with individual mentions to everyone in the group (excluding blacklisted users) so everyone gets notified. 
DEV Community

Useful for group announcements

You can make variants: @active mentions only recently active users, or @silent mentions users who haven’t posted recently

3. Bridging / cross-chat / channel sync bots

Several GitHub projects exist that bridge GroupMe with Discord or other chat networks. E.g. groupme-discord-bridge syncs messages between a GroupMe group and a Discord channel. 
GitHub

You can use that to funnel users from one platform to another, or replicate messages for wider reach

Also, “GroupMe-Chat-Data-Analysis” repo is for analyzing chat logs, which can help you detect active users, trending content, etc. 
GitHub

4. Content / media scraping & backup

Some bots / scripts download full group content including attachments (images, files) for backup or analytics. E.g., GroupMe Saver project grabs message history + attachments. 
GitHub

Using that, you can mine all images posted and surface them as “best of” posts

Or re-post high-performing media later

5. Analytics-driven profiling

Using message metadata (favorited_by, number of likes, message counts) you can build scoring of users (top posters, most “liked”) and then target promotions to them. The NodeJS message analysis tutorial shows how to parse favorited_by, count messages per user, etc. 
DEV Community

Use this to rank users for VIP invites or special treatment

Use liking, mentions, or DM to reward top users

6. Bot marketplaces / “Bot as a service” platforms

There is a platform MeBots that lets you deploy your bot to many GroupMe groups with minimal setup. 
MeBots

If your bot is modular, you can use MeBots to scale to more groups easily

You can also watch how other bots are structured there (commands, triggers)

7. Masked command triggers (aliasing)

Some bots allow you to alias commands, e.g. !deal, @promo, #offer all point to the same logic, which helps users naturally activate it.

You can also hide commands: e.g. detect phrases like “need X” (without prefix) and silently trigger the logic, so users don’t have to know commands.

8. Self-replicating bot invites

Bots could monitor when they are adding new users, then auto-invite those who interact to other bots or nested groups. For example, if someone asks “deal?”, the bot adds them to another deals group as well.

Cautious: aggressive replication might trigger limits or bans, but selective replication based on interaction is more stealthy.

9. Using the “members/results” polling hack

When doing bulk adds, after posting POST /groups/{id}/members/add, you get a results_id. Polling GET /groups/{id}/members/results/{results_id} tells you which invites succeeded quickly. You can then act immediately (DM, tag, etc.).

Use that to split between those who accepted vs declined and send customized follow-ups (e.g. “Welcome!” only to accepted ones).

10. “Ghost re-add” detection / antighost logic

Some users may leave and rejoin via group share links or via bug. Use bots to detect multiple join events in quick succession from the same user_id and flag or re-kick them automatically. (GORT’s antighost concept is this kind of logic.)

Use webhook events + state to detect suspicious join / leave patterns and intervene.

Wild / Speculative Ideas (Beyond What’s Seen)

Behavior-based group splitting: use your analytics module to detect clusters (users who respond to offers vs users who don’t) and automatically fork subgroups tailored to each, moving or inviting users accordingly.

Invisible A/B test messaging: send variant affiliate links / pitches to small subsets of the group (e.g. via DM) and compare which format converts best — then broadcast the winning format to the rest.

“Bot introduction” seeding: in large external groups (that allow bots), sneak in a post “I run a deals bot group — DM me if you want exclusive deals.” Use your bot’s share link to capture interested users without overt mass-adding.

Message latency exploitation: intentionally delay posting in some cases so that when conversation is dying down, your posts appear “fresh” in feed, increasing visibility.

Shadow mode / quiet mode: have a mode where bot only responds when specifically addressed (via prefix), so the group doesn’t see constant bot messages — but the bot is ready to jump in when asked. This preserves atmosphere while letting automation exist.

Dynamic context-trigger promotions: your bot reads “hot topics” in the chat (e.g. someone mentions “shoes”) and injects an offer related to that topic automatically but subtly (“just saw a deal on shoes — here: …”), so the promotion feels part of the conversation.

Cross-group “teaser” posting: post a snippet (quote + link) in external groups or forums that references a message in your premium group — driving curiosity and new joins.
